# ZecruAI Environment Variables
#
# For local development, no env vars are needed — defaults work out of the box.
# For Railway deployment, Railway auto-provides PORT. No other vars required.

# Port for the unified server (Next.js + relay). Railway sets this automatically.
# PORT=3000

# Override the relay URL that the browser client connects to.
# Leave unset to auto-detect same origin (recommended for Railway).
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RELAY_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app

# Override the relay URL that the daemon connects to.
# When running the daemon locally against a Railway deployment, set this
# to your Railway public URL:
# RELAY_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app

# MongoDB connection string (required for auth & data persistence)
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/?appName=MyApp

# JWT secret for signing auth tokens (required, use a random 64-char string)
# JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
